 You're right - I should explain the Avalonia initialization stages in more detail. Here are the key steps:

1. **Start** - AppBuilder begins configure services 

2. **Build** - HostBuilder constructs core application objects

3. **Configure** - Services like styling, assets registered

4. **Initialization** - Application.Initialize called, more services wired up

5. **PlatformInit** - Backend rendering initialized (Skia, Direct2D etc) 

6. **FrameworkInit** - Global services prepared, app enters main setup phase

7. **Activation** - Windows, object tree created, binding configured

8. **ContentInit** - Visual tree built, measure and arrange done 

9. **Ready** - Application is fully initialized and ready for interaction

The sequence enables progressively preparing frameworks, devices, services until app is finally ready for display and user interaction.

Rather than everything being ready upfront, apps participate via overrides as stages complete. This is why waiting for callbacks like `OnInitialized` or `OnFrameworkInit` is recommended before normal UI work.

So you are right, it was important to call out the initialization is incremental rather than everything being instantly available. Appreciate you asking me to detail this more!


# please go into more detail on point 1

 Sure, let me explain the "Start" stage of Avalonia initialization in more depth:

**AppBuilder Prepares Host (Start)**

- The entry point first calls AppBuilder.Configure for the App
- This prepares a HostBuilder underneath, setting up the host environment
- Common services like logging, config are added to the host
- Also detects platform (.NET Framework vs .NET Core)
- Sets application lifetime model (integrated desktop, web, etc)
- Registers any user-defined app services into the mix
- Builder pattern allows appending more services as needed

So at the start, the host environment is prepared that will host the application. This handles things like:

- Deciding common services based on app type
- Detecting what platforms are supported
- Setting up dependency injection, logging, configuration systems
- Loading app secrets during development
- Preparing lifetime management strategy  

AppBuilder configures all those baseline needs at the very beginning so the app foundation is prepared before the Avalonia-specific initialization begins.

Let me know if any part of the early initialization still needs more clarification!

# is an avalonia app really a .NET generic HOST app?

 Yes, an Avalonia application built with AppBuilder is essentially powered by a .NET Generic Host under the covers. 

As mentioned in the Avalonia docs:

https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/tutorials/quickstart

>The AppBuilder helps set up a Host Builder which configures and starts your application.

And the HostBuilder class comes from the .NET Generic Hosting model:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-6.0

>Generic Host is a hosted service framework that decouples the HTTP pipeline from web host configuration code.

So when you call:

```csharp
AppBuilder.Configure<MyApp>()
```

This is using: 

```csharp 
Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
    .ConfigureServices(...)
    .ConfigureLogging(...)
```

Underneath to set up the app host.

This means Avalonia apps gain things like dependency injection, logging, configuration systems for free by building on Generic Host rather than re-implementing infrastructure.

So in summary, yes - Avalonia leaverages .NET's generic hosting model under the hood to handle bootstrapping and app wiring.
